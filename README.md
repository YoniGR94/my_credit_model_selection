## Credit Model Selection
#### Using multiple models to evaluate Credit balance

The goal of this project is  to present different approaches to predict numeric prediction with data frame.

I used some methods I was taught the University, especially from the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)

The data is Credit from the [ILSR package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ISLR/versions/1.2/topics/Credit)

This project will show which of the models are better: Those who are based on linear regression,
or those who use randomness and deep learning.

the models:

* Linear- Regression

* Lasso- Regulated linear regression

* Random Forrest- Average of multiple trees

* xgboost- Algorithm of gradient boosting trees

* Neural network- machine learning using multiple layers

This was created for 2 main reasons
1. An exercise on what I have learned of "data predictions using R"
2. To be a base to future prediction work in the future
