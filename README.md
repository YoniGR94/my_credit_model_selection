The goal of this project is  to present different approaches to predict numeric prediction with data frame.
I used some methods I was taught the University, ecpecialy from the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)

The data is Credit from ILSR package* 

 <font size="2"> *[RDocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ISLR/versions/1.2/topics/Credit)</font>

This project will show which of the models are better: Those who are based on linear regression,
or those who use randomness and deep learning are better.

This was created for 2 main reasons
1. An exercise on what I have learned of "data predictions using R"
2. To be a base to future prediction work in the future
