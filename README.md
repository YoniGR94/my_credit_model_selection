The goal of this project is  to present different approaches to predict numeric prediction with data frame.

I used some method thouthg in the University, ecpecialy from the book  [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)

the data is Credit from ILSR pachage*

This project will show wich of the models are better: Those who are based on linear regression,
or those who use randomness and deep learning are better.

This is also my own practice on a set of data from R, in order to use similar script for real predictions,
 in which the result is cache in the future.
